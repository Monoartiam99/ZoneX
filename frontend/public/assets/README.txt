Place your desired homepage background image here as 'vlx.jpg'.

Path: frontend/public/assets/vlx.jpg

Vite will serve files placed under frontend/public at the root URL '/'. The CSS is written to use '/assets/vlx.jpg'. If you drop a JPEG file named 'vlx.jpg' into this folder and restart the dev server (or reload the page), it will be used as the homepage background. If no JPG exists, a built-in SVG fallback (vlx.svg) will be used instead.
